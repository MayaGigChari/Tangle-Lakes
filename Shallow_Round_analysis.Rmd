```{r setup, include=FALSE}

#need to push these changes to github. 
#if these packages are not installed, need to install to knit document.
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

#source the parent files that we wnat to work with. 

source('Data_preparation_forRmd.R')
source('maps_and_viz.R')

#we don't really need to source this, but we will just in case. 
source('growth_correction.R')
```

## First 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
